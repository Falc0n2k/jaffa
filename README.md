<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created Jaffa when I couldn't find exactly what I wanted in a Ghost theme. I found [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter) and liked a lot of the core elements within it, but I was still stuck on the overall design of the theme I was using at that time, [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor). This project is a combination of both themes, bringing the design elements I liked the best into one theme.

Jaffa uses Open Sans and Open Sans Condensed via Google Fonts. The colors used within the theme are Pantone colors. The name of the theme comes from primary accent color [Jaffa orange](http://www.pantone.com/color-finder/16-1454-TCX).

The Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License. Other icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and released under SIL OFL 1.1.

### Installation

0. [Make sure you've got a working install of Ghost.](https://ghost.org/docs/install/)

1. Log into your Ghost blog and navigate to **Settings**. Your blog settings page will have a URL like ghost.org/blogs/yourblogname/ and is used for things like controlling domain settings and installing custom themes. 

2. Once you’re in the settings page for your blog, click the large **Upload Your Theme Zip File** button in the right column.

3. After selecting your theme zip file, click the large blue Save All Blog Settings button near the bottom of your blog’s settings page. This will automatically initiate the process of uploading and activating the theme on your blog, during which you’ll see a loading icon on the blue button. When the theme installation is complete you’ll see a green bar appear across the top of your blog settings page.
