# Jaffa

I created *Jaffa* when I couldn't find exactly what I wanted in a Ghost theme. I found [*Ghostwriter*](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter) and liked a lot of the core elements within it, but I was still stuck on the overall design of my current theme, [*Vapor*](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor). This project is a combination of both themes, bringing the design elements I liked the best into one theme. You can see *Jaffa* in action at [The Classic Yuppie](https://classicyuppie.com/).

Fonts embedded via Google Fonts. *Jaffa* uses Open Sans and Open Sans Condensed. The colors used within the theme are Pantone colors. The name of the theme comes from primary accent color [Jaffa Orange](http://www.pantone.com/color-finder/16-1454-TCX).
