# Jaffa

*Jaffa* is a theme that allows your content to be the true center of your Ghost blog. Before I decided to change the my site's Ghost theme, I found [*Ghostwriter*](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter). I liked a lot of the core elements within it, but I was still stuck on the overall design of my current theme, [*Vapor*](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor). This project is a portmanteau of both projects, combining the elements I liked the best.

Fonts embedded via Google Fonts. *Jaffa* uses Open Sans and Open Sans Condensed.

Colors used within the theme are Pantone colors. The name of the theme comes from primary accent color [Jaffa Orange](http://www.pantone.com/color-finder/16-1454-TCX).

The Ghost, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons are trademarks of their respective owners and are from the Casper theme, copyright (c) 2013 Ghost Foundation and released under The MIT License.

Other icons provided by [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and released under SIL OFL 1.1.
